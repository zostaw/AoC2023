# Advent of Code 2023

My advent of code solutions.
This year I'm starting with Rust, but I might change the language during the advent.
I want to challenge myself to try unortodox things, so sometimes I might try to write the most efficient code, other time to implement some UI to visualize the stuff, other times I'll just write a code as it goes. I believe there is a value in experimentation, for it shows us different ways of doing things and builds good intuitions about efficient solutions. By playing with unorthodox solutions one connects elements of the system that are usually not connected, hence opening an opportunity to find abstractions never seen before. It is a silly art, oh how precious. The greatest things that happened for humanity come from naivity of exploration.


The code will be organized in following fashion:

```
___________________-/

  \                \
   | [day_01]      |
   | - Cargo.toml  |
    \              /
     \             |
      | [src]      \
      | - part1.rs |
      | - part2.rs |
     /             /
    /              |
   | [day_02]      |
   | - Cargo.toml  |
    \              /
     \             |
      | [src]      \
      | - part1.rs |
      | - part2.rs |

      | [src]      \
      | - part1.rs |
      | - part2.rs |
     /             /
    /              |
   | [day_25]      |
